# Currency-Eye

Currency eye project
I'm using Privat24\CBR\Cryptonator api to gether all information about currency exchange rates of USD, UAH, RUR, BTC.
I create my own api. You can get JSON\XML with all rates.
I have all logs in db. You can check it on page /logs/api and /logs/error if you have permission.
Also i create scheduler job (clock) which updates our exchange rates every minute.
